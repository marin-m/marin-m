## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal Github profile. I'm an IT security engineer living in France. Feel free to browse https://moulinier.dev for my portfolio or [@p1-mmr](https://github.com/p1-mmr) for my professional profile.

I have been initially self-taught and the author of the [SongRec](https://github.com/marin-m/SongRec) desktop app as well as several reverse engineering and auditing tools such as [vmlinux-to-elf](https://github.com/marin-m/vmlinux-to-elf), [pbtk](https://github.com/marin-m/pbtk), [hermes-dec](https://github.com/P1sec/hermes-dec) and [QCSuper](https://github.com/P1sec/QCSuper).

I use Python 3.x and Flask/Vue.JS on a professional basis in my day job and have been working in entreprise-scale applications leveraging Linux-first system development using C, Lua, MySQL, Elasticsearch/Kibana in a professional context. I also have background skill in reverse engineering x86, ARM, MIPS, Android apps, Java and working with PHP and PostgreSQL.
